## üîß Installation & Setup

### How do I verify my installation is working?

After installation, run demo report `ZDEMO_EXCEL1` to create a simple Excel file. If it executes successfully, your installation is complete! üéâ

### Which installation method should I use?

| Method | Best For | Requirements |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **abapGit Online** | Modern systems with internet access | SAP_ABA 702+, HTTPS connectivity |
| **abapGit Offline** | Restricted networks | SAP_ABA 702+, ZIP file download |
| **SAPLink** | Legacy systems only | SAP_ABA < 702 |

For detailed instructions, see our [Getting Started Guide](../GETTING_STARTED_FOR_BEGINNERS.md).

### Demo programs don't appear after installation

Demo programs are in a [separate repository](https://github.com/abap2xlsx/demos). Install them separately after the main library:

1. Create package: `$ABAP2XLSXDEMOS` or `ZABAP2XLSXDEMOS`
2. Clone: `https://github.com/abap2xlsx/demos`

## üìä Version & Compatibility

### How do I check which version is installed?

**Method 1: Check class attribute**

```abap
" Check the VERSION constant in class ZCL_EXCEL
```

**Method 2: Generate demo report**

- Run any `ZDEMO_EXCEL*` report
- Check the generated XLSX file properties
- Version appears in the description field

### What SAP versions are supported?

- **Minimum tested**: SAP_ABA 731
- **Older versions**: May work but need community testing
- **Legacy systems**: Use SAPLink for systems < SAP_ABA 702

### How often are new versions released?

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with regular releases every 1-2 months.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

### "Interface method are not implemented" error after import

**Solution**: Import the SAPLink nugget twice. This is a known SAPLink issue.

### Objects won't activate after SAPLink installation

**Solution**: Follow the exact activation order:

### Demo reports don't compile - `CL_BCS_CONVERT` not available

**Solution**: Implement SAP OSS Notes:

- [Note 1151257 - Converting document content](https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/1151257)
- [Note 1151258 - Error when sending Excel attachments](https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/1151258)

### `SUBMIT` with `STRING` parameter causes DB036 error

**Solution**: Implement SAP OSS Note:

- [Note 1385713 - SUBMIT: Allowing parameter of type STRING](https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/1385713)

### HTTPS connection fails during abapGit installation

**Solutions**:

1. **Use offline method**: Download ZIP and import via abapGit offline
2. **Certificate issues**: Import certificates in transaction `STRUST`
3. **Proxy settings**: Configure your system's internet connection

### Package naming conflicts

**Avoid these patterns**:

- ‚ùå `Z_ABAP2XLSX_DEMO` (underscore patterns cause issues)
- ‚ùå `ZABAP2XLSX_DEMOS` (conflicts with internal naming)

**Use instead**:

- ‚úÖ `$ABAP2XLSX` (local package)
- ‚úÖ `ZABAP2XLSX` (transportable package)
- ‚úÖ `$ABAP2XLSXDEMOS` (demo package)

## üöÄ Performance & Usage

### How do I download XLSX files in background jobs?

Run report `ZDEMO_EXCEL25` for background download examples.

### Which writer should I use for large datasets?

| Writer | Best For | Performance |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `zcl_excel_writer_2007` | Standard files (< 100k rows) | Good |
| `zcl_excel_writer_huge_file` | Large datasets (> 100k rows) | Optimized |
| `zcl_excel_writer_csv` | Simple data export | Fastest |

### How do I optimize Excel file generation?

**Tips for better performance**:

1. Use `zcl_excel_writer_huge_file` for large datasets
2. Minimize conditional formatting rules
3. Avoid complex formulas in large ranges
4. Use table binding instead of individual cell setting

### Font issues with Calibri and auto-width calculation

**Solution**: Upload Calibri font files via transaction `SM73`:

- Upload all four variants (regular, bold, italic, bold+italic)
- Use exact description "Calibri"
- Ensures accurate width calculations
