## How to submit changes

Changes are handled via the usual pull request mechanism; clear, short PRs for bugfixes are best because they're easy to review but sometimes, especially with new features, the changes are more substantial: in this case please provide an overview and pointers to the most relevant changes to be checked. If possible, a PR should not exist in a vacuum, rather it should address or even close an issue already filed. This way, the relevant context can be provided without cluttering the PR itself.

### Review process

With the possible exception of the original authors it is recommended that contributors go through the PR process, even when they have push access. A different contributor will then review the PR, provide feedback on possible reworks or even merge it directly if all is in order. It is also possible to review changes and have someone else merge them, of course.

### Keeping PR up to date

When the review process takes a long time, regardless of the reason, the changes proposed by the PR might fall behind the master branch. If the author of the PR has allowed it (default setting in GitHub), another contributor might come along and merge the master branch into the PR branch, thereby freshening it. When conflicts happen, however, the PR author should resolve them. By all means, if necessary ask for help in the conversation section of the PR. If a PR lies dormant for too long, an effort will be made to get in touch with the author, to ensure the request is still relevant.
