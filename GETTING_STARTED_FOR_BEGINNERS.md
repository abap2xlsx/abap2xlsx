> **For ABAP developers new to open source and Git**

This guide will walk you through installing and using abap2xlsx in your SAP system, even if you've never worked with Git or open source projects before.

## üìã What You'll Need Before Starting

### System Requirements
- **SAP System**: Minimum SAP_ABA 731 (may work on older versions)
- **Developer Access**: Ability to create packages and transport objects
- **HTTPS Support**: Your SAP system must be able to connect to GitHub (for online method)

### üîß Required Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Required For |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **abapGit** | Downloads code from GitHub | ‚úÖ Primary installation method |
| **SAPLink** | Legacy installation tool | ‚ö†Ô∏è Only for systems < SAP_ABA 702 |

## üéØ Installation Methods

### Method 1: abapGit Online Installation (Recommended)

abapGit is like a bridge between GitHub (where the code lives) and your SAP system. [1](#1-0) 

#### Step 1: Install abapGit

1. **Check if abapGit is already installed**
   - Go to transaction `SE38`
   - Look for report `ZABAPGIT_STANDALONE`
   - If it exists, skip to Step 2

2. **Install abapGit (if not present)**
   - Visit: https://docs.abapgit.org/guide-install.html
   - Download the latest `zabapgit_standalone.prog.abap` file
   - Create a new program `ZABAPGIT_STANDALONE` in SE38
   - Copy/paste the downloaded content
   - Save and activate

3. **Handle HTTPS Certificates (if needed)**
   - If your system uses two-factor authentication
   - Go to transaction `STRUST`
   - Import certificates from `https://api.github.com`

#### Step 2: Create Your Package

üé® **Package Naming Guide:**

#### Step 2: Install abapGit (if not already done)

Follow the same abapGit installation steps from Method 1, Step 1.

#### Step 3: Create Your Package

Follow the same package creation steps from Method 1, Step 2.

#### Step 4: Import ZIP File via abapGit

1. **Run abapGit**
   - Execute report `ZABAPGIT_STANDALONE`
   - The abapGit interface will open

2. **Import ZIP File**
   - Click "New Offline"
   - Enter a repository name (e.g., "abap2xlsx")
   - Select your package (created in Step 3)
   - Click "Create offline repo"

3. **Upload ZIP Content**
   - In the offline repository view, click "ZIP"
   - Click "Import ZIP"
   - Browse and select your downloaded ZIP file
   - Click "Import"
   - The system will extract and process the ZIP contents

4. **Install Objects**
   - After ZIP import, click "Pull"
   - Review the objects to be imported
   - Click "Pull" to install all abap2xlsx objects
   - Wait for the process to complete

#### Step 5: Verify Installation

‚úÖ **Check these objects exist and are active:**
- Class `ZCL_EXCEL` (main workbook class)
- Class `ZCL_EXCEL_WRITER_2007` (creates Excel files) [2](#1-1) 
- Class `ZCL_EXCEL_WORKSHEET` (manages worksheets)

### Method 3: SAPLink Installation (Legacy Systems Only)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Only use this method for SAP systems older than SAP_ABA 702** [1](#1-0) 

#### Prerequisites
- Install SAPLink from http://www.saplink.org
- Install SAPLink plugins (complete nugg package recommended) [3](#1-2) 

#### Installation Steps
1. Download the `.nugg` file from the build folder
2. Execute report `ZSAPLINK`
3. Select "Import Nugget" and locate your file
4. Check "overwrite originals" only if updating existing installation [4](#1-3) 

#### Critical: Activation Order
Objects must be activated in this specific sequence: [5](#1-4) 

1. All domains
2. All data elements  
3. Database Tables/Structures (except specific ones listed)
4. Table Types (except specific ones listed)
5. All interfaces/classes
6. Remaining structures
7. Remaining table types
8. Demo reports

## üéÆ Installing Demo Programs

Demo programs show you how to use abap2xlsx and are great for learning.

### Step 1: Create Demo Package
- Package name: `$ABAP2XLSXDEMOS` (local) or `ZABAP2XLSXDEMOS` (transportable)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't use** formats like `ZABAP2XLSX_DEMOS` (causes issues)

### Step 2: Install Demos (Online Method)
1. In abapGit, click "New Online"
2. Enter URL: `https://github.com/abap2xlsx/demos`
3. Select your demo package
4. Click "Clone online repo" and "Pull"

### Step 2: Install Demos (Offline Method)
1. Download ZIP from: https://github.com/abap2xlsx/demos
2. In abapGit, click "New Offline"
3. Create offline repository for demos
4. Import the demos ZIP file
5. Click "Pull" to install demo programs

### Step 3: Try Your First Demo
- Execute report `ZDEMO_EXCEL1`
- This creates a simple Excel file
- If it works, your installation is successful! üéâ

## üîç Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Objects won't activate** | Follow the exact activation order for SAPLink installations |
| **HTTPS connection fails** | Use offline ZIP method instead |
| **ZIP import fails** | Ensure ZIP file is not corrupted, try re-downloading |
| **Package naming conflicts** | Use unique package names, avoid underscore patterns |
| **Missing dependencies** | Ensure all SAPLink plugins are installed (legacy method) |
| **abapGit not found** | Install abapGit standalone program first |

## üìö Your First Excel Program

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```abap
REPORT zdemo_my_first_excel.

DATA: lo_excel     TYPE REF TO zcl_excel,
      lo_worksheet TYPE REF TO zcl_excel_worksheet,
      lo_writer    TYPE REF TO zcl_excel_writer_2007.

" Create new workbook
CREATE OBJECT lo_excel.

" Get active worksheet
lo_worksheet = lo_excel->get_active_worksheet( ).

" Add some data
lo_worksheet->set_cell( ip_column = 'A' ip_row = 1 ip_value = 'Hello' ).
lo_worksheet->set_cell( ip_column = 'B' ip_row = 1 ip_value = 'World!' ).

" Create writer and save
CREATE OBJECT lo_writer.
" Add your save logic here
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Explore Demo Programs** - Run various `ZDEMO_EXCEL*` reports to see capabilities
2. **Read the Documentation** - Check the wiki for advanced features
3. **Join the Community** - Ask questions on SAP Community Network
4. **Start Small** - Begin with simple Excel generation before complex formatting

## üìñ Understanding the Basics

### What is Git?
Git is a version control system that tracks changes in code. Think of it like a detailed history of every change made to the abap2xlsx library.

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a website that hosts Git repositories (code projects). The abap2xlsx code lives on GitHub and is freely available.

### What is abapGit?
abapGit is a tool that brings Git functionality to SAP systems, allowing you to download and manage open source ABAP code.

### Online vs Offline Installation
- **Online**: Direct connection to GitHub, always gets latest version, requires internet access
- **Offline**: Uses downloaded ZIP files, works in restricted networks, allows version control
